# Three Phase Controlled Inverter using PWM Technique

Working on Hardware project Basically Inverter is used to Convert DC Current to AC Current.
# Features

* Here we are working on 3-Phase because efficieny and power output increases. 
* But with controlled Inverter we can control the output DC Voltage because MOSFET as a switch can used to differ the output voltage by adjusting the pulse duration given to MOSFET from Arduino.

# Key Tools Used
* ARDUINO UNO
* MATLAB(Simulink) 
* Electrical Equipment like Transformer ,MOSFET, Diode Bridge Rectifier etc.
* DC Supply


# Key Accomplishment
* Improving my skills to deal the electrical equipment with the MATLAB Software.
* Came to know how to burn MATLAB Simulink in Arduino UNO.

# Progress

Till now we have completed the First phase of this Project

* In phase 1 Do all the simulation on the MATLAB and Properly analys the result.

* In phase 2 we are going to implement Every individual circuit(e.g Bridge Circuit, MOSFET Gate Driver etc) and check the output of individual circuit.

* In phase 3 we Make the connection between ARDUINO UNO, MATLAB , and the Hardware Circuit that we implement.
